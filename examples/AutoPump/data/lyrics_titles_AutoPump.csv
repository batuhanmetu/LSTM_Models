Young nigga from them hood with a plan
One foot in the street, one foot in the sand
One foot in the cleats, one foot in the Vans
One foot in your ass, one fourth of a Xan
Follow my footsteps, I give you instructions
Swallow, don't belch, you just drunk quintuplets
On my one-of-one shit, I keep it a hundred
Boy, I talk my shit, then wipe my shit with hundreds
You can't stunt like me, rich as fuck like me
Lil' black ass nappy head nigga
Let me shout out India.Arie, and ain't none like me
Mr. Dwayne Carter, only got one ID, yerr

Stay in your own lane or make me bowl that strike, yerr

(Lil Pump)
Call me El Gato Guwop or Mustafa the 3rd
Back in the day they was callin' me Ray
Run with the yay, drum on the K
Fuck with Lil Pump, you get shot in the face
Gucci the gang so we watchin' the snakes (Gucci)
Made me eight mil' so I bought her a Wraith (mwah)
Two shows in a day, brick on the plate
L.A. to the A then it's back to the Bay
Gucci gang, eskimo, froze like the North Pole (brr)
Jumpin' out the whip just to pose in my Gucci robe (Wop)
Woke up in the picture, Bam Bam Bigelow
Gucci Mane a jiggalo, diamonds in my Figaro
Oh you know what, bro? I ain't even know
Walkin' out the Gucci store, 'bout to spend a hundred so
Lil' bitty bitch, with a big booty though
She a dancer but a grade A student though
Pump went to Harvard, well fuck it, I'm goin' to Yale (Wop)
Free Meek Mill, free all my niggas in jail (jail)
Gucci to death, I'm really a gang by myself (Gucci gang)
Feelin' myself, tuck in my shirt, show off my belt (it's Gucci)

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)

Got a snake on my collar, I ain't rockin' no diamonds
Y'all lil' niggas poppin', that's chump change
Got an FN and a Draco
But I still fucked around and hit him with the lil' pump, mane
I Saint Laurent my garments, lil' bitch, pardon me
You still stay with your mama, lil' bitch, pardon me
I run through the money like it grow on trees
You can't afford new hair, you like to hold on weave
Double cup red, huh, just to match my 'Rari, huh
I don't even drive it, spent a quarter just to park it
Gucci on my daughter, and she still a toddler
She can barely talk but she know that her dad a baller

Nah, you ain't like me
You ride the wave, you ain't like me
Cop some chains, you ain't like me
Made a hook, you ain't like me
Bills ain't bills, a nigga like me
Before the Gucci gang was the Gucci Mane (Mane)
Couldn't see my life through a Gucci frame (frame)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Somebody please tell me where my money machine at
My money dirty, I'm tryna think of ways I can clean that
I spent at least 3 million dollars just on the pieces
These haters think they can keep up, man, they can't believe it
Gucci got a six-pack, they can't believe it
But hey, lil bitch, here's three stacks, let's have a threesome
I wanna own it outright, don't wanna lease it
He wanna be Guwop so bad that he talkin' greasy
She wanna be with Wop so bad that she fuck the DJ
That bitch should prolly' ride a bicycle on the freeway
Three years ago, I stacked my paper the long way
Now I'm stacking million dollar checks up the grown way
